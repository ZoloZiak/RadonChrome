# RadonChrome
RadonChrome is a SIMBL extension for Mac OS X to redirect Chrome notifications to Notification Center. I cannot guarantee it will work for you, but I'm currently using it with Yosemite and 64-bit Chrome 40.

### Usage
SIMBL extensions naturally require a SIMBL install on your system for use. I personally recommend [EasySIMBL](https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL). Given SIMBL is installed: clone the repository, compile the .xcodeproj, and drag/drop the compiled .bundle into EasySIMBL. Restart Chrome, and give notifications a shot! (I used [this page](http://jsbin.com/ziwod/1/edit?html,js,output) to test notifications while building the extension.)

If you don't feel like compiling RadonChrome yourself, I've released a 1.0 binary here on GitHub that you can download from [this page](https://github.com/mathcolo/RadonChrome/releases).

**NOTE (July 2, 2015): EasySIMBL is not currently functional on OS X 10.10.4/10.11. EasySIMBL's developer has posted [a workaround](https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL/issues/26#issuecomment-117028426) which might work for you.
