# RadonChrome
RadonChrome is a SIMBL extension for Mac OS X to redirect Chrome notifications to Notification Center. I cannot guarantee it will work for you, but I'm currently using it with Yosemite and 64-bit Chrome 40.

### Usage
SIMBL extensions naturally require a SIMBL install on your system for use. I personally recommend [EasySIMBL](https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL). 

**NOTE (July 2, 2015): EasySIMBL is not currently functional on OS X 10.9.5+, 10.10.4+, and 10.11. As an alternative you can use SIMBL 0.9.9 and this [workaround](https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL/issues/26#issuecomment-117028426).**


Given SIMBL is installed either: 

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the .xcodeproj
3. Restart Chrome, and give notifications a shot! 

or

1. Download the binary [HERE](https://github.com/mathcolo/RadonChrome/releases).
2. 

(I used [this page](http://jsbin.com/ziwod/1/edit?html,js,output) to test notifications while building the extension.)
